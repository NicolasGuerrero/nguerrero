              After 11 years working as an electrical engineer in the solar and semiconductor 
              manufacturing equipment industry, I have decided to pursue software engineering. 
              While at Miasole I was given the opportunity to work on several software projects. 
              I self-studied and was able to deliver projects using C#. I found myself wanting 
              to learn more about coding and software development. I realized that I wanted to 
              work on software full-time rather than occasional side projects.

            I am enrolled at Rithm School and will begin attending January 2020.
